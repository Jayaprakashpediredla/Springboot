# Springboot

This repo will guide you through building and deploying a fully functional, secure, well-tested RESTful API for a hypothetical Family Cash Card application.

**What Will You Build?**
You'll be building a simple Family Cash Card application â€” a modern way for parents to manage allowance funds for their kiddos.

You'll use Spring Boot to progress from creating a single cash card in a database to allowing for the editing, deleting, and viewing of multiple cash cards, and finally securing your app against unauthorized access and unwanted exploits.

**By the end of the course, you'll be able to:**

Utilize Spring Boot to build a complete RESTful API while understanding the benefits and tradeoffs of REST.
Learn what Spring Boot offers to application developers and how it differs from the Spring Framework.
Build Web applications with Spring Web.
Use Spring Data to connect databases and map relational data to Java objects.
Use Spring Security to develop software with a Security First approach.

**Steel Thread**
We'll approach building our application using a Steel Thread. The idea is to first create a "thread" through all the integration points of the application. Completing the thread first has advantages, including:

Incremental delivery: It results in an end-to-end, executable application to which we can add functionality.
Risk mitigation: It can reveal hidden technical hurdles throughout the system earlier rather than later.

The three integration points in our application are the API "front door", the database, and security.


As we build our Family Cash Card API we will use,
Spring MVC for the web application, 
Spring Data for data access, and 
Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
